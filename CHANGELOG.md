# Head

-   Added: support for asynchronous plugin rules ([#2351](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2351)).

# 7.9.0

-   Added: `ignoreFontFamilyName` option to `font-family-no-duplicate` ([#2314](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2314)).
-   Added: `ignorePattern` option to `max-line-length` ([#2333](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2333)).
-   Fixed: update version of `lodash` dependency to match feature usage, fixing a conflict with Modernizr ([#2353](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2353)).
-   Fixed: `color-hex-case` false positives for id references in `url` functions ([#2338](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2338)).
-   Fixed: `max-line-length` now reports correct column for SCSS comments ([#2340](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2340)).
-   Fixed: `selector-class-pattern` false positive in SCSS when combining interpolated and nested selectors ([#2344](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2344)).
-   Fixed: `selector-type-case` false positive for placeholder selectors ([#2360](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2360)).

# 7.8.0

-   Deprecated: 15 rules ([#2197](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2197),  [#2285](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2285) & [#2309](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2309)).
    -   `block-no-single-line`. Use `block-opening-brace-newline-after` and `block-closing-brace-newline-before` rules with the option `"always"` instead.
    -   `declaration-block-properties-order`. Use the [`stylelint-order`](https://github.com/hudochenkov/stylelint-order) plugin pack instead.
    -   `rule-nested-empty-line-before` and `rule-non-nested-empty-line-before`. Use the new `rule-empty-line-before` rule instead.
    -   `time-no-imperceptible`. Use the new `time-min-milliseconds` rule with `100` as its primary option.
    -   It is beyond the scope of stylelint's core package to effectively validate against the CSS spec. Please investigate [csstree](https://github.com/csstree/csstree) and [css-values](https://github.com/ben-eb/css-values) for this functionality, and contribute to those projects and to stylelint plugins wrapping them. csstree already has a [stylelint plugin](https://github.com/csstree/stylelint-validator), and css-values needs one to be developed. The following rules are deprecated for this reason.
        -   `media-feature-no-missing-punctuation`.
        -   `selector-no-empty`.
    -   A plugin is a better package for a rule that wraps a third-party library. The following rules are deprecated for this reason. We encourage users to create and help maintain plugins for these rules.
        -   `no-browser-hacks`
        -   `no-indistinguishable-colors`
        -   `no-unsupported-browser-features`
    -   The following rules did not seem useful. If you liked these rules, please create plugins for them.
        -   `custom-property-no-outside-root`
        -   `root-no-standard-properties`
        -   `selector-root-no-composition`.
    -   The following rules did not work well.
        -   `stylelint-disable-reason`. Please consider contributing to [#2292](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/issues/2292) for a replacement.
        -   `declaration-block-no-ignored-properties` could not reliably account for *replaced elements*.
-   Deprecated: 4 options ([#2213](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2213)).
    -   `"all-nested"` option for `at-rule-empty-line-before`. Use the `"inside-block"` option instead.
    -   `"blockless-group"` option for `at-rule-empty-line-before`. Use the `"blockless-after-blockless"` option instead.
    -   `"between-comments"` option for `comment-empty-line-before`. Use the `"after-comment"` option instead.
    -   `"at-rules-without-declaration-blocks"` option for `max-nesting-depth`. Use the `"blockless-at-rules"` option instead.
-   Added: `time-min-milliseconds` rule, to replace `time-no-imperceptible` ([#2289](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2289)).
-   Added: `except: ["after-same-name"]` option to `at-rule-empty-line-before` ([#2225](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2225)).
-   Fixed: `configOverrides` now work with `extends` ([#2295](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2295)).
-   Fixed: `max-line-length` no longer reports incorrect column positions for lines with `url()` or `import` ([#2287](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2287)).
-   Fixed: `selector-pseudo-class-no-unknown` no longer warns for proprietary webkit pseudo-classes ([#2264](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2264)).
-   Fixed: `unit-no-unknown` accepts `fr` units ([#2308](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2308)).

# 7.0.1

-   Fixed: missing `known-css-properties` dependency.

# 7.0.0

-   Removed: `--extract` and `extractSyleTagsFromHtml` options. Instead, [build](/docs/developer-guide/processors.md) and [use](/docs/user-guide/configuration.md#processors) processors.
-   Removed: support for plugin rule names that aren't namespaced, i.e. only `your-namespace/your-rule-name` rule names are supported. (If your plugin provides only a single rule or you can't think of a good namespace, you can simply use `plugin/my-rule`.)
-   Removed: `--verbose` CLI flag. Use `--formatter verbose` instead.
-   Removed: NodeJS `0.12.x` support. `4.2.1 LTS` or greater is now required.
-   Removed: `media-query-parentheses-space-inside` rule. Use the new `media-feature-parentheses-space-inside` rule instead.
-   Removed: `no-missing-eof-newline` rule. Use the new rule `no-missing-end-of-source-newline` instead.
-   Removed: `number-zero-length-no-unit` rule. Use the `length-zero-no-unit` rule instead.
-   Removed: `property-unit-blacklist` rule. Use the `declaration-property-unit-blacklist` rule instead.
-   Removed: `property-unit-whitelist` rule. Use the `declaration-property-unit-whitelist` rule instead.
-   Removed: `property-value-blacklist` rule. Use the `declaration-property-value-blacklist` rule instead.
-   Removed: `property-value-whitelist` rule. Use the `declaration-property-value-whitelist` rule instead.
-   Removed: `"emptyLineBefore"` option for `declaration-block-properties-order`. If you use this option, please consider creating a plugin for the community.
-   Removed: `"single-where-required"`, `"single-where-recommended"`, `"single-unless-keyword"`, `"double-where-required"`, `"double-where-recommended"` and `"double-unless-keyword"` options for `font-family-name-quotes`. Instead, use the `"always-unless-keyword"`, `always-where-recommended` or `always-where-required` options together with the `string-quotes` rule.
-   Removed: `"single"`, `"double"` and `"none"` options for `function-url-quotes`. Instead, use the `"always"` or `"never"` options together with the `string-quotes` rule.

-   Removed: `stylelint.utils.styleSearch()`. Use the external [style-search](https://github.com/davidtheclark/style-search) module instead.
-   Changed: invalid configuration sets result's `stylelintError` to `true`, which in turn causes CLI to exit with a non-zero code.
-   Changed: non-standard syntaxes are automatically inferred from file extensions `.scss`, `.less`, and `.sss`.
-   Changed: `.stylelintignore` now uses `.gitignore` syntax, and stylelint looks for it in `process.cwd()`.
-   Changed: files matching ignore patterns no longer receive an "info"-severity message, which was always printed by the string formatter. Instead, the file's stylelint result object receives an `ignored: true` property, which various formatters can use as needed. The standard `string` formatter prints nothing for ignored files; but when the `verbose` formatter is used, ignored files are included in the filelist.
-   Changed: plugin arrays in extended configs are now concatenated with the main config's plugin array, instead of being overwritten by it. So plugins from the main config and from extended configs will all be loaded.
-   Changed: `-v` flag to display version number.
-   Changed: `comment-word-blacklist` no longer ignores words within copyright comments.
-   Changed: `comment-word-blacklist` will now identify strings within comments, rather than just at the beginning of, when the string option is used.
-   Changed: `declaration-block-no-ignored-properties` now detects use of `min-width` and `max-width` with `inline`, `table-row`, `table-row-group`, `table-column` and `table-column-group` elements.

-   Changed: `declaration-block-no-ignored-properties` now ignores the combination of `float` and `display: inline-block | inline`.
-   Changed: `font-family-name-quotes` now checks the `font` property in addition to the `font-family` property.
-   Changed: `font-family-name-quotes` treats `-apple-*` and `BlinkMacSystemFont` system fonts as keywords that should never be wrapped in quotes.
-   Changed: `indentation` now checks inside of parentheses by default. If you use the `indentInsideParens: "once"` secondary option, simply remove it from your config. If you do not want to check inside of parentheses, use the new `ignore: ["inside-parens"]` secondary option. The `indentInsideParens: "twice"` and `indentInsideParens: "once-at-root-twice-in-block"` secondary options are unchanged.
-   Changed: `keyframe-declaration-no-important` now checks vendor prefixed `@keyframes` at-rules.
-   Changed: `selector-attribute-quotes` now checks attribute selectors with whitespace around the operator or inside the brackets.
-   Changed: `time-no-imperceptible` now checks vendor prefixed properties.
-   Changed: `unit-*` rules now check `@media` values too.
-   Added: plugins can allow primary option arrays by setting `ruleFunction.primaryOptionArray = true`.
-   Added: [processors](/docs/user-guide/configuration.md#processors).
