# 8.0.0

This release is accompanied by:

-   A new [semantic version policy](README.md#semantic-versioning-policy). The use of the tilde (`~`) in `package.json` is now recommended, e.g. `"stylelint": "~8.0.0"`, to guarantee the results of your builds ([#1865](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/issues/1865)).
-   A new [VISION document](VISION.md), complemented by ([#2704](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2704)):
    -   The restructuring of the [list of rules](docs/user-guide/rules.md) into three groups:
        -   [Possible errors](docs/user-guide/rules.md#possible-errors).
        -   [Limit language features](docs/user-guide/rules.md#limit-language-features).
        -   [Stylistic issues](docs/user-guide/rules.md#stylistic-issues).
    -   The release of a new sharable config, [`stylelint-config-recommended`](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-recommended). This config only turns on the [possible error](docs/user-guide/rules.md#possible-errors) rules.  [`stylelint-config-standard`](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard) now builds on top of the recommended config by turning on over 60 additional [stylistic rules](docs/user-guide/rules.md#stylistic-issues).

The following rules are deprecated for this reason.
        -   `media-feature-no-missing-punctuation`.
        -   `selector-no-empty`.
    -   A plugin is a better package for a rule that wraps a third-party library. The following rules are deprecated for this reason. We encourage users to create and help maintain plugins for these rules.
        -   `no-browser-hacks`
        -   `no-indistinguishable-colors`
        -   `no-unsupported-browser-features`
    -   The following rules did not seem useful. If you liked these rules, please create plugins for them.

-   Deprecated: 4 options ([#2213](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pull/2213)).

# 7.0.1

-   Removed: `--extract` and `extractSyleTagsFromHtml` options. Instead, [build](/docs/developer-guide/processors.md) and [use](/docs/user-guide/configuration.md#processors) processors.
-   Removed: support for plugin rule names that aren't namespaced, i.e. only `your-namespace/your-rule-name` rule names are supported. (If your plugin provides only a single rule or you can't think of a good namespace, you can simply use `plugin/my-rule`.)
-   Removed: `--verbose` CLI flag. Use `--formatter verbose` instead.
-   Removed: NodeJS `0.12.x` support. `4.2.1 LTS` or greater is now required.
-   Removed: `media-query-parentheses-space-inside` rule. Use the new `media-feature-parentheses-space-inside` rule instead.
-   Removed: `no-missing-eof-newline` rule. Use the new rule `no-missing-end-of-source-newline` instead.
-   Removed: `number-zero-length-no-unit` rule. Use the `length-zero-no-unit` rule instead.
-   Removed: `property-unit-blacklist` rule. Use the `declaration-property-unit-blacklist` rule instead.

-   Removed: `property-value-blacklist` rule. Use the `declaration-property-value-blacklist` rule instead.
-   Removed: `property-value-whitelist` rule. Use the `declaration-property-value-whitelist` rule instead.
-   Removed: `"emptyLineBefore"` option for `declaration-block-properties-order`. If you use this option, please consider creating a plugin for the community.
-   Removed: `"single-where-required"`, `"single-where-recommended"`, `"single-unless-keyword"`, `"double-where-required"`, `"double-where-recommended"` and `"double-unless-keyword"` options for `font-family-name-quotes`. Instead, use the `"always-unless-keyword"`, `always-where-recommended` or `always-where-required` options together with the `string-quotes` rule.
-   Removed: `"single"`, `"double"` and `"none"` options for `function-url-quotes`. Instead, use the `"always"` or `"never"` options together with the `string-quotes` rule.
-   Removed: `"hierarchicalSelectors"` option for `indentation`.  If you use this option, please consider creating a plugin for the community.

-   Changed: `.stylelintignore` now uses `.gitignore` syntax, and stylelint looks for it in `process.cwd()`.
-   Changed: files matching ignore patterns no longer receive an "info"-severity message, which was always printed by the string formatter. Instead, the file's stylelint result object receives an `ignored: true` property, which various formatters can use as needed. The standard `string` formatter prints nothing for ignored files; but when the `verbose` formatter is used, ignored files are included in the filelist.
-   Changed: plugin arrays in extended configs are now concatenated with the main config's plugin array, instead of being overwritten by it. So plugins from the main config and from extended configs will all be loaded.
-   Changed: `-v` flag to display version number.
-   Changed: `comment-word-blacklist` no longer ignores words within copyright comments.
-   Changed: `comment-word-blacklist` will now identify strings within comments, rather than just at the beginning of, when the string option is used.

-   Changed: `font-family-name-quotes` treats `-apple-*` and `BlinkMacSystemFont` system fonts as keywords that should never be wrapped in quotes.
-   Changed: `indentation` now checks inside of parentheses by default. If you use the `indentInsideParens: "once"` secondary option, simply remove it from your config. If you do not want to check inside of parentheses, use the new `ignore: ["inside-parens"]` secondary option. The `indentInsideParens: "twice"` and `indentInsideParens: "once-at-root-twice-in-block"` secondary options are unchanged.
