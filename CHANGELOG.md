# 7.0.0

- Removed: `"emptyLineBefore"` option for `declaration-block-properties-order`. If you use this option, please consider creating a plugin for the community. See the [release planning](/docs/user-guide/release-planning.md) document for more details.
- Removed: `"single-where-required"`, `"single-where-recommended"`, `"single-unless-keyword"`, `"double-where-required"`, `"double-where-recommended"` and `"double-unless-keyword"` options for `font-family-name-quotes`. Instead, use the `"always-unless-keyword"`, `always-where-recommended` or `always-where-required` options together with the `string-quotes` rule.
- Removed: `"single"`, `"double"` and `"none"` options for `function-url-quotes`. Instead, use the `"always"` or `"never"` options together with the `string-quotes` rule.
- Removed: `"hierarchicalSelectors"` option for `indentation`.  If you use this option, please consider creating a plugin for the community. See the [release planning](/docs/user-guide/release-planning.md) document for more details.
- Removed: support for plugin rule names that aren't namespaced, i.e. only `your-namespace/your-rule-name` rule names are supported. If your plugin provides only a single rule or you can't think of a good namespace, you can simply use `plugin/my-rule`).
- Removed: `stylelint.utils.cssWordIsVariable()`.
- Removed: `stylelint.utils.styleSearch()`. Use the external [style-search](https://github.com/davidtheclark/style-search) module instead.
- Removed: `--verbose` CLI flag.
- Changed: `-v` flag to display version number.
- Changed: invalid configuration sets result's `stylelintError` to `true`, which in turn causes CLI to exit with a non-zero code.
- Changed: `declaration-block-no-ignored-properties` now detects use of `min-width` and `max-width` with inline, table-row, table-row-group, table-column and table-column-group elements.
- Changed: `declaration-block-no-ignored-properties` now detects use of `overflow`, `overflow-x` and `overflow-y` with inline elements.
- Changed: `font-family-name-quotes` treats `-apple-*` and `BlinkMacSystemFont` system fonts as keywords that should never be wrapped in quotes.
- Changed: files matching ignore patterns no longer receive an "info"-severity message, which was always printed by the string formatter. Instead, the file's stylelint result object receives an `ignored: true` property, which various formatters can use as needed. The standard string formatter prints nothing for ignored files; but in `--verbose` mode, ignored files are included in the filelist.
- Changed: `comment-word-blacklist` no longer ignores words within copyright  comments
- Added: non-standard syntaxes are automatically inferred from file extensions `.scss`, `.less`, and `.sss`.
- Fixed: The string options of `comment-word-blacklist` will now identify strings *within* comments.
