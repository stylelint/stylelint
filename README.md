A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles.

## Features

It's mighty because it:

-   has over **160 built-in rules** to catch errors, apply limits and enforce stylistic conventions
-   understands the **latest CSS syntax** including custom properties and level 4 selectors
-   parses **CSS-like syntaxes** like SCSS, Sass, Less and SugarSS
-   extracts **embedded styles** from HTML, markdown and CSS-in-JS template literals
-   automatically **fixes** some violations (*experimental feature*)
-   supports **plugins** so you can create your own rules or make use of plugins written by the community
-   is **well tested** with over 10000 unit tests
-   supports **shareable configs** that you can extend or create your own of
-   is **unopinionated** so you can tailor the linter to your exact needs
-   has a **growing community** and is used by [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/posts/879890885467584/improving-css-quality-at-facebook-and-beyond/), [GitHub](https://github.com/primer/stylelint-config-primer) and [WordPress](https://github.com/ntwb/stylelint-config-wordpress/)

## Getting started

It's easy to get started.

First, decide how you want to use stylelint:

-   [on the command line](docs/user-guide/cli.md)
-   [in your text editor](docs/user-guide/complementary-tools.md#editor-plugins), for example in VS Code
-   [in for your build tool](docs/user-guide/complementary-tools.md#build-tool-plugins), for example in webpack
-   [via the Node API](docs/user-guide/node-api.md)
-   [as a PostCSS plugin](docs/user-guide/postcss-plugin.md)

Then, create your [configuration object](docs/user-guide/configuration.md).

You can either extend a shared configuration or craft your own.

### Extend a shared configuration

It's the quickest way to get started. We suggest extending either:

-   [`stylelint-config-recommended`](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-recommended)
-   [`stylelint-config-standard`](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard)

The recommended one turns on the [possible error](docs/user-guide/rules.md#possible-errors) rules. The standard config builds on it by turning on over 60 of the [stylistic rules](docs/user-guide/rules.md#stylistic-issues) with sensible defaults. We update these configs with each release of stylelint, so it's easy to stay up to date.

However, you can use a community config, for example [`stylelint-config-recommended-scss`](https://github.com/kristerkari/stylelint-config-recommended-scss), if you use non-standard syntax like `@if`, `@extends` etc.

You can always override rules after extending any config. You may also want to add some rules that [limit language features](docs/user-guide/rules.md#limit-language-features) as these will be specific to your team and/or project.

### Craft your own config

Alternatively, you can [learn about the rules](docs/user-guide/about-rules.md) and then either:

-   start small and add only [the rules](docs/user-guide/rules.md) you want to turn on
-   copy, paste and adapt [this example configuration](docs/user-guide/example-config.md) which lists all of the rules and their primary options

## Semantic Versioning Policy

We have a [semantic versioning policy](docs/user-guide/semantic-versioning-policy.md). Any minor update may report more errors than the previous release. As such, we recommend using the tilde (`~`) in `package.json` e.g. `"stylelint": "~7.2.0"` to guarantee the results of your builds.
