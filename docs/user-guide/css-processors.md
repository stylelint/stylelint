# CSS processors

The linter supports current and future CSS syntax. This includes all standard CSS but also special features that use standard CSS syntactic structures, e.g. special at-rules, special properties, and special functions. Some CSS-*like* language extensions -- features that use non-standard syntactic structures -- are, as such, supported; however, since there are infinite processing possibilities, the linter cannot support everything.

You can run the linter before or after your CSS processors. Depending on which processors you use, each approach has caveats:

1.  *Before*: Some plugins/processors might enable a syntax that isn't compatible with the linter.
2.  *After*: Some plugins/processors might generate CSS that is invalid against your linter config, causing violations that do not correspond to your original stylesheets.

*In both cases you can either turn off the incompatible linter rule, or stop using the incompatible plugin/processor.* You could also approach plugin/processor authors and request alternate formatting options that will make their plugin/processor compatible with stylelint.

## Parsing non-standard syntax

stylelint will automatically infer the syntax from the:

-   file extension
-   `type` or `lang` attribute on `<style>` tags in HTML (and HTML-like)
-   [info string](https://github.github.com/gfm/#info-string) on [GFM fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) in Markdown

You can force a specific syntax, though. Both the [CLI](cli.md) and the [Node.js API](node-api.md) expose a `syntax` option.

-   If you're using the CLI, use the `syntax` flag like so:  `stylelint ... --syntax scss`.
-   If you're using the Node.js API, pass in the `syntax` option like so: `stylelint.lint({ syntax: "sugarss", ... })`.

stylelint can also accept a custom [PostCSS-compatible syntax](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#syntaxes) when using the CLI or Node.js API. For custom syntaxes, use the `custom-syntax` and `customSyntax` options, respectively.

-   If you're using the CLI, use the `custom-syntax` flag like so:  `stylelint ... --custom-syntax custom-syntax-module` or `stylelint ... --custom-syntax ./path/to/custom-syntax-module`.
-   If you're using the Node.js API, pass in the `customSyntax` option like so: `stylelint.lint({ customSyntax: path.join(process.cwd(), './path/to/custom-syntax-module') , ... })`.

If you're using the linter as a [PostCSS Plugin](postcss-plugin.md), you should use the special `postcss-syntax` directly with PostCSS's `syntax` option like so:

```js
const postcss = require('postcss');
const syntax = require('postcss-syntax');

postcss([
  require('stylelint'),
  require('reporter'),
])
  .process(css, {
      from: 'lib/app.css',
      syntax: syntax,
  });
```
