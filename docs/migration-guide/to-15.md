# Migrating to 15.0.0

This release contains significant and breaking changes that will help us modernize our code so that Stylelint remains free of security issues.

## Significant change

Two significant changes may affect you:

- deprecated stylistic rules
- added `declaration-property-value-no-unknown` rule

### Deprecated stylistic rules

We deprecated [most of the rules that enforce stylistic conventions](../user-guide/rules.md#deprecated). You should remove these rules from your configuration object.

We recommend:

- using a pretty printer, like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), alongside Stylelint
- extending [our standard config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-standard) in your configuration object

Stylelint and pretty printers are complementary tools that work together to help you write consistent and error-free code. To help facilitate this, we've removed the [deprecated rules](../user-guide/rules.md#deprecated) from the latest version of [our standard config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-standard). You can [extend](../user-guide/configure.md#extends) the config using:

```diff json
{
+ "extends": ["stylelint-config-standard"],
  "rules" { .. }
}
```

[Our standard config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-standard) turns on many of the [other rules that enforce conventions](../user-guide/rules.md#enforce-conventions), e.g. most of the [`*-notation`](../user-guide/rules.md#notation), [`*-pattern`](../user-guide/rules.md#pattern) and [`*-quotes`](../user-guide/rules.md#quotes) rules. We recommend adding more of [the rules that enforce conventions](../user-guide/rules.md#enforce-conventions) to your config as many of them will be specific to your needs, e.g. what [units you allow](../../lib/rules/unit-allowed-list/README.md) in your code.

For example, you can:

- [allow, disallow and require many things](../user-guide/rules.md#allowed-disallowed--required)
- [set limits on things like selectors](../user-guide/rules.md#max--min)

Additionally, you may no longer need to extend [Prettier's Stylelint config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-prettier) as there should be no conflicting rules:

```diff json
{
- "extends": ["stylelint-config-prettier"],
  "rules" { .. }
}
```

If you want to continue using Stylelint to enforce stylistic consistency, you can [migrate the deprecated rules you need to a plugin](../developer-guide/plugins.md). We will remove the rules from Stylelint in the next major release.

### Added `declaration-property-value-no-unknown` rule

We added the [`declaration-property-value-no-unknown`](../../lib/rules/declaration-property-value-no-unknown/README.md) rule and turned it on in our [recommended](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-recommended) and [standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-standard) configs.

The rule checks for unknown property-value pairs in declarations. If you use values that aren't in the CSS specifications, you can use the rule's secondary options to make the rule more permissive. You can either:

- ignore properties or values outright
- extend the properties and values syntaxes

The latter is a powerful approach that ensures only specific exceptions are allowed.

We hope to add more rules like this to Stylelint that help you [avoid errors](../user-guide/rules.md#avoid-errors) in your code.

## Breaking changes

Three breaking changes may also affect you:

- removed support for Node.js 12
- removed support for processors
- changed `overrides.extends` behavior

## Removed support for Node.js 12

You should use the following or higher versions of Node.js:

- 14.13.1
- 16.0.0

### Removed support for processors

You should use a [custom syntax](../developer-guide/syntaxes.md)](../developer-guide/syntaxes.md) instead.

### Changed `overrides.extends` behavior

To be consistent with the `overrides.plugins`, `overrides.extends` will merge rather than replace.

If you would like to keep the previous behavior, you should change your config to:

```diff json
{
- "extends": ["config-a"],
  "overrides": [
    {
      "rules": ["*.module.css"],
      "extends": ["config-b"]
    },
+   {
+     "rules": ["*.css"],
+     "extends": ["config-a"]
+   }
  ]
}
```
