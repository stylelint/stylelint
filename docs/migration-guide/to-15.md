# Migrating to 15.0.0

## Change of `overrides.extends` behavior

We changed the `overrides.extends` behavior to merge rather than replace, to make it consistent with the `overrides.plugins`.

If you would like to keep the previous behavior, you should change your config to:

```diff json
{
- "extends": ["config-a"],
  "overrides": [
    {
      "rules": ["*.module.css"],
      "extends": ["config-b"]
    },
+   {
+     "rules": ["*.css"],
+     "extends": ["config-a"]
+   }
  ]
}
```

## Node.js 12

Support for Node.js 12 was dropped. You should use the following or higher versions of Node.js:

- 14.13.1
- 16.0.0
