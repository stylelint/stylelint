# Migrating to 16.0.0

This release contains significant or breaking changes.

## Significant changes

We've:

- changed report to be consistent and predictable in how it handles the provided position arguments

### Changed `report` to be consistent and predictable in how it handles the provided position arguments

We've changed `report` so that it'll throw an error for the ambiguous position arguments that we deprecated in [16.13.0](https://stylelint.io/CHANGELOG#16130---2025-01-12).

You should update your plugin(s) to:

- always provide a PostCSS `node`
- provide both `start` and `end` as valid positions, if providing a [range](https://postcss.org/api/#range) within the given node
- provide both `index` and `endIndex` as numbers, if providing an index range within the given node

For example:

```diff js
root.walkRules((ruleNode) => {
  const { selector } = ruleNode;

  report({
    result,
    ruleName,
    message: messages.rejected(),
    node: ruleNode,
    index,
+   endIndex: index + selector.length
  });
});
```
