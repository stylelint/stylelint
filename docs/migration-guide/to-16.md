# Migrating to 16.0.0

This release contains significant or breaking changes.

## Significant changes

- added support for ESM plugins

### Added support for ESM plugins

You can now create ESM plugins for Stylelint. This involved a year-long effort to migrate our codebase to ESM. We've updated our [developer guide](../developer-guide/plugins.md) with examples of ESM syntax.

## Breaking changes

This release contains breaking changes. We've:

- removed deprecated stylistic rules
- removed support for Node.js less than 18.12.0
- changed `.js` extension to `.mjs` and `.cjs`
- changed Node.js API returned resolved object
- changed Node.js API `stylelint.formatters` object
- changed Node.js API `stylelint.rules` object
- changed Node.js API `stylelint.utils.checkAgainstRule()` function
- changed CLI to print problems to stderr
- changed CLI exit code for flag errors

### Removed deprecated stylistic rules

We've removed the stylistic rules we deprecated in 15.0.0.

You should remove the rules from your configuration object. See the [15.0.0 migration guide](./to-15.md#deprecated-stylistic-rules) for more details.

## Removed support for Node.js less than 18.12.0

Node.js 14 and 16 have reached end-of-life. We've removed support for them so that we could update some of our dependencies.

You should use the 18.12.0 or higher versions of Node.js.

### Changed `.js` extensions to `.mjs` and `.cjs`

We've changed the file extension `.js` to `.mjs` and `.cjs` to support ESM and CJS.

You should modify your code if using `.js` for `import` or `require`. For example:

ESM:

```diff js
-import('stylelint/lib/utils/typeGuards.js');
+import('stylelint/lib/utils/typeGuards.mjs');
```

CJS:

```diff js
-require('stylelint/lib/utils/typeGuards.js');
+require('stylelint/lib/utils/typeGuards.cjs');
```

> [!WARNING]
> We've strongly recommended copying the internal utilities to your project instead of importing them.
> You can unsafely continue to `import` or `require` the files, but we will disallow access to them in the next major release.
> See also [`stylelint.utils`](../developer-guide/plugins.md#stylelintutils) in the developer guide.

### Changed Node.js API returned resolved object

We've changed the resolved object of the Promise returned by `stylelint.lint()` so that:

- a new [`report`](../user-guide/node-api.md#report) property contains the formatted problems
- a new [`code`](../user-guide/node-api.md#code-1) property contains the autofixed code
- the [`output`](../user-guide/node-api.md#output) property is now deprecated in favor of the new `report` and `code` properties and will be removed in the next major version

If you use `stylelint.lint()` to lint a source string and the `fix` option is `true`, the `report` property will contain the formatted problems and the `code` property will contain the fixed code.

```diff js
async function lint() {
  const result = await stylelint.lint({
    code: "a {}",
    fix: true
  });
- const fixedCode = result.output;
+ const formattedProblems = result.report;
+ const fixedCode = result.code;
}
```

If you use `stylelint.lint()` to lint files, the `code` property will always be `undefined`.

### Changed Node.js API `stylelint.formatters` object

We've changed the [`stylelint.formatters`](../developer-guide/formatters.md#stylelintformatters) object in the Node.js API so that every formatter is a `Promise` function.

```diff js
-const formatter = stylelint.formatters.json;
+const formatter = await stylelint.formatters.json;
```

### Changed Node.js API `stylelint.rules` object

We've changed the [`stylelint.rules`](../developer-guide/plugins.md#stylelintrules) object in the Node.js API so that every rule is a `Promise` function.

```diff js
-const rule = stylelint.rules['block-no-empty'];
+const rule = await stylelint.rules['block-no-empty'];
```

### Changed Node.js API `stylelint.utils.checkAgainstRule()` function

We've changed the [`stylelint.utils.checkAgainstRule()`](../developer-guide/plugins.md#stylelintutilscheckagainstrule) function in the Node.js API so that it's an async function.

```diff js
-checkAgainstRule({
+await checkAgainstRule({
```

### Changed CLI to print problems to stderr

We've changed the CLI to print problems to stderr instead of stdout.

If you use the [`--fix`](../user-guide/cli.md#--fix) and [`--stdin`](../user-guide/cli.md#--stdin) options, the CLI will print the fixed code to stdout and any problems to stderr.

### Changed CLI exit code for flag errors

We've changed the exit code for CLI flag errors from `2` to `64` so that `2` is only used for lint problems.

If you're an author of an editor integration that uses the CLI, you can now distinguish between flag errors and lint problems.
