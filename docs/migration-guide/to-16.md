# Migrating to 16.0.0

This release contains breaking changes. We've:

- removed deprecated stylistic rules
- removed support for Node.js 14
- changed Node.js API returned resolved object
- changed CLI to print problems to stderr
- changed CLI exit code for flag errors

## Removed deprecated stylistic rules

We've removed the stylistic rules we deprecated in 15.0.0.

You should remove the rules from your configuration object. See the [15.0.0 migration guide](./to-15.md#deprecated-stylistic-rules) for more details.

## Removed support for Node.js 14

Node.js 14 has reached end-of-life. We've removed support for it so that we could update some of our dependencies.

You should use the following or higher versions of Node.js:

- 16.13.0
- 18.0.0

## Changed Node.js API returned resolved object

We changed the resolved object of the Promise returned by `stylelint.lint()` so that:

- the [`output`](../user-guide/node-api.md#output) property now only contains formatted problems
- a new [`code`](../user-guide/node-api.md#code-1) property contains the autofixed code

If you use `stylelint.lint()` to lint a source string and the `fix` option is `true`, the `output` property will contain the formatted problems and the `code` property will contain the fixed code.

```diff js
async function lint() {
  const result = await stylelint.lint({
    code: "a {}",
    fix: true
  });
- const fixedCode = result.output;
+ const fixedCode = result.code;
}
```

If you use `stylelint.lint()` to lint files, the `code` property will always be `undefined`.

## Changed CLI to print problems to stderr

We've changed the CLI to print problems to stderr instead of stdout.

If you use the [`--fix`](../user-guide/cli.md#--fix) and [`--stdin`](../user-guide/cli.md#--stdin) options, the CLI will print the fixed code to stdout and any problems to stderr.

## Changed CLI exit code for flag errors

We've changed the exit code for CLI flag errors from `2` to `64` so that `2` is only used for lint problems.

If you're an author of an editor integration that uses the CLI, you can now distinguish between flag errors and lint problems.
