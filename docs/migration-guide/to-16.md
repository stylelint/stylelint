# Migrating to 16.0.0

This release contains breaking changes.

## Removed deprecated stylistic rules

We've removed the stylistic rules we deprecated in 15.0.0. See the [15.0.0 migration guide](./to-15.md) for details on how to migrate.

## Removed support for Node.js 14

Node.js 14 has reached end-of-life. We've removed support for it so that we could update some of our dependencies. You should use the following or higher versions of Node.js:

- 16.13.0
- 18.0.0

## Changed CLI to avoid waiting for stdin without any input

If you run the CLI without any input files or input from stdin, the CLI immediately exits with some message (help, error, etc.). Before 16.0.0, the CLI waited for input from stdin.

```sh
# Before 16.0.0
stylelint
# waiting for stdin...

# After 16.0.0
stylelint
# show help and then exit
```

## Changed CLI to print problems to stderr instead of stdout

If you use the CLI to fix a source string by using the [`--fix`](../user-guide/cli.md#--fix) and [`--stdin`](../user-guide/cli.md#--stdin) options, the CLI will print the fixed code to stdout and any problems to stderr.

## Changed Node.js API returned resolved object

We changed the resolved object of the Promise returned by `stylelint.lint()` so that:

- the [`output`](../user-guide/node-api.md#output) property now only contains formatted problems
- a new [`code`](../user-guide/node-api.md#code-1) property contains the autofixed code

This means if you use `stylelint.lint()` to lint a source string and the `fix` option is set to `true`, the `output` property will be the formatted problems and the `code` property will be the fixed code.

If you use `stylelint.lint()` to lint files, then the `code` property will always be `undefined`.
