# Migrating to 16.0.0

This release contains breaking changes.

## Removed deprecated stylistic rules

We've removed the stylistic rules we deprecated in 15.0.0. See the [15.0.0 migration guide](./to-15.md) for details on how to migrate.

## Removed support for Node.js 14

Node.js 14 has reached end-of-life. We've removed support for it so that we could update some of our dependencies. You should use the following or higher versions of Node.js:

- 16.13.0
- 18.0.0
