# Migrating to 16.0.0

This release contains breaking changes.

## Removed deprecated stylistic rules

We've removed the stylistic rules we deprecated in 15.0.0. See the [15.0.0 migration guide](./to-15.md) for details on how to migrate.

## Removed support for Node.js 14

Node.js 14 has reached end-of-life. We've removed support for it so that we could update some of our dependencies. You should use the following or higher versions of Node.js:

- 16.13.0
- 18.0.0

## Changed CLI to print problems to stderr instead of stdout

If you use the CLI to fix a source string by using the [`--fix`](../user-guide/cli.md#--fix) and [`--stdin`](../user-guide/cli.md#--stdin) options, the CLI will print the fixed code to stdout and any problems to stderr.

## Changed Node.js API returned resolved object

We changed the resolved object of the Promise returned by `stylelint.lint()` so that:

- the [`output`](../user-guide/node-api.md#output) property now only contains formatted problems
- a new [`code`](../user-guide/node-api.md#code-1) property contains the autofixed code

This means if you use `stylelint.lint()` to lint a source string and the `fix` option is set to `true`, the `output` property will be the formatted problems and the `code` property will be the fixed code.

If you use `stylelint.lint()` to lint files, then the `code` property will always be `undefined`.
