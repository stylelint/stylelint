# Syntaxes

There are many styling languages, ranging from CSS language extension like SCSS to entirely different notations like CSS-in-JS objects. These styling languages can be then be embedded within other languages, including HTML `<style>` tags, markdown fences and JavaScript variables.

We aim to support all these use cases, but it's a complicated task.

We use [PostCSS syntaxes](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#syntaxes) to transform these languages into something that resembles CSS, which is the language that:

-   underpins all the other styling languages
-   is best understood by stylelint

We need your help to [support and improve](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/blob/master/docs/syntax.md) the following PostCSS syntaxes:

-   [postcss-css-in-js](https://github.com/stylelint/postcss-css-in-js)
-   [postcss-html](https://github.com/gucong3000/postcss-html)
-   [postcss-less](https://github.com/webschik/postcss-less)
-   [postcss-markdown](https://github.com/stylelint/postcss-markdown)
-   [postcss-sass](https://github.com/AleshaOleg/postcss-sass)
-   [postcss-scss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-scss)
