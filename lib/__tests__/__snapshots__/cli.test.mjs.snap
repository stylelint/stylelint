  A mighty CSS linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions.

  Usage: stylelint [input] [options]

  Input: Files(s), glob(s), or nothing to use stdin.

    If an input argument is wrapped in quotation marks, it will be passed to
    globby for cross-platform glob support. "node_modules" are always ignored.
    You can also pass no input and use stdin, instead.

  Options:

    --config, -c <path_or_module>

      A path to a specific configuration file (JSON, YAML, CommonJS, or ES module),
      or a module name in "node_modules" that points to one. If no argument is
      provided, Stylelint will search for configuration files in the following
      places, in this order:

        - a "stylelint" property in "package.json"
        - a ".stylelintrc" file
        - a ".stylelintrc.{cjs,mjs,js,json,yaml,yml}" file
        - a "stylelint.config.{cjs,mjs,js}" file

      The search will begin in the working directory and move up the directory
      tree until a configuration file is found.

    --config-basedir <path>

      An absolute path to the directory that relative paths defining "extends",
      "plugins", and "customSyntax" are *relative to*. Only necessary if these
      values are relative paths.

    --print-config

      Print the configuration for the given input file path. Globs are unsupported.

    --ignore-path, -i <path>

      A path to a file containing patterns that describe files to ignore. The
      path can be absolute or relative to "process.cwd()". You can repeat the
      option to provide multiple paths. By default, Stylelint looks for
      ".stylelintignore" in "process.cwd()". Multiple can be set.

    --ignore-pattern, --ip <pattern>

      A pattern of files to ignore (in addition to those in ".stylelintignore").
      Multiple can be set.

    --fix

      Automatically fix problems of certain rules.

    --custom-syntax <name_or_path>

      A module name or path to a JS file exporting a PostCSS-compatible syntax.

    --stdin

      Accept stdin input even if it is empty.

    --stdin-filename <name>

      A filename to assign stdin input.

    --ignore-disables, --id

      Ignore "stylelint-disable" comments.

    --disable-default-ignores, --di

      Allow linting of "node_modules".

    --[no-]cache

      Store the info about processed files in order to only operate on the
      changed ones the next time you run Stylelint. By default, the cache is
      stored in "./.stylelintcache". To adjust this, use "--cache-location".
      Cache is disabled by default.

    --cache-location <path>

      A path to a file or directory to be used for the cache location. If a
      directory is specified, a cache file will be created inside the specified
      folder, with a name derived from a hash of the current working directory.

      If the directory for the cache does not exist, make sure you add a trailing "/"
      on *nix systems or "\\" on Windows. Otherwise the path will be assumed to
      be a file.

    --cache-strategy <strategy>

      A strategy for the cache to use for detecting changed files. Either one of:

        metadata     by metadata of a file (default)
        content      by content of a file

      The "content" strategy can be useful in cases where the modification time
      of your files changes even if their contents have not. For example, this can
      happen during git operations like "git clone" because git does not track file
      modification time.

    --formatter, -f <formatter>

      An output formatter. The variants are as follows:

        string       human-readable strings (default)
        compact      similar to ESLint's compact formatter
        github       workflow commands for GitHub Actions
        json         JSON format
        tap          TAP format
        unix         C compiler-like format
        verbose      extend "string" to include a file list and a tally

    --custom-formatter <path_or_module>

      A path to a JS file or module name exporting a custom formatting function.

    --quiet, -q

      Only register problems for rules with an "error"-level severity (ignore
      "warning"-level).

    --quiet-deprecation-warnings

      Ignore deprecations warnings.

    --[no-]color

      Force enabling/disabling of color.

    --report-needless-disables, --rd

      Also report errors for "stylelint-disable" comments that are not blocking
      a lint warning. The process will exit with code 2 if needless disables are found.

    --report-invalid-scope-disables, --risd

      Report "stylelint-disable" comments that used for rules that don't exist
      within the configuration object. The process will exit with code 2 if invalid
      scope disables are found.

    --report-descriptionless-disables, --rdd

      Report "stylelint-disable" comments without a description. The process will
      exit with code 2 if descriptionless disables are found.

    --max-warnings, --mw <number>

      The number of warnings above which the process will exit with code 2.
      Useful when setting "defaultSeverity" to "warning" and expecting the process
      to fail on warnings (e.g. CI build).

    --output-file, -o <path>

      A file path to write a report.

    --allow-empty-input, --aei

      When a glob pattern matches no files, the process will exit without throwing an error.

    --globby-options, --go <json>

      Options in JSON format passed to globby.

    --version, -v

      Show the version.

    --help, -h

      Show the help.
