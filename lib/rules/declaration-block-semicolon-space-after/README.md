# declaration-block-semicolon-space-after

Require a single space or disallow whitespace after the semicolons of declaration blocks.

```css
a { color: pink; top: 0; }
/**            â†‘
 * The space after this semicolon */
```

This rule ignores semicolons that are preceded by Less mixins.

This rule ignores the last semicolon of declaration blocks. Use the `block-closing-brace-*-before` rules to control the whitespace between the last semicolon and the closing brace instead.
