# selector-no-deprecated

Disallow deprecated selectors.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
applet {}
/** â†‘
 * This selector */
```

This rule flags selectors that were removed or deprecated after being in the CSS specifications, including Editor Drafts, and were either:

- shipped in a release browser version
- shipped in a pre-release browser version
- shipped but behind feature flags
- polyfilled with some adoption before any browser shipped
- given an MDN page

The [`fix` option](../../../docs/user-guide/options.md#fix) can automatically fix some of the problems reported by this rule.
