# media-feature-name-no-unknown

Disallow unknown media feature names.

```css
@media (min-width: 700px) {}
/**     â†‘
 * These media feature names */
```

This rule considers media feature names defined in the CSS Specifications, up to and including Editor's Drafts, to be known.

All vendor-prefixed media feature names are ignored.

Caveat: Media feature names within a [range context](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/#mq-ranges) are currently ignored.
