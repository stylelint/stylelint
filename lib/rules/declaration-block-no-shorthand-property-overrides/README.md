# declaration-block-no-shorthand-property-overrides

Disallow shorthand properties that override related longhand properties.

```css
a { background-repeat: repeat; background: green; }
/**                            â†‘
 * This overrides the longhand property before it */
```

In almost every case, this is just an authorial oversight. For more about this behavior, see [MDN's documentation of shorthand properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties).
