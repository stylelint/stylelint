# string-quotes

Specify single or double quotes around strings.

```css
a[id="foo"] { content: "x"; }
/**  ↑   ↑             ↑ ↑
 * These quotes and these quotes */
```

Quotes within comments are ignored.


```css
/* "This is fine" */
/* 'And this is also fine' */
```

Single quotes in a charset @-rule are ignored as using single quotes in this context is incorrect according the [CSS specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#x57).

```css
@charset "utf-8"
/* fine regardless of configuration */
```

The `--fix` option on the [command line](../../../docs/user-guide/cli.md#autofixing-errors) can automatically fix all of the problems reported by this rule.
