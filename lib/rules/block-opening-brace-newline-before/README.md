Refer to [combining rules](../../../docs/user-guide/rules/combine.md) for more information on using this rule with [`block-opening-brace-newline-after`](../block-opening-brace-newline-after/README.md) to disallow single-line rules.

The [`fix` option](../../../docs/user-guide/usage/options.md#fix) can automatically fix all of the problems reported by this rule.
