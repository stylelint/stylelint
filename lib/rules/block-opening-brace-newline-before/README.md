# block-opening-brace-newline-before

Require a newline or disallow whitespace before the opening brace of blocks.

```css
  a
    { color: pink; }
/** â†‘
 * The newline before this brace */
```

Refer to [the FAQ](../../../docs/user-guide/faq.md#how-do-i-disallow-single-line-blocks) for more information on using this rule with [`block-opening-brace-newline-after`](../block-opening-brace-newline-after/README.md) to disallow single-line rules.

The `--fix` option on the [command line](../../../docs/user-guide/cli.md#autofixing-errors) can automatically fix all of the problems reported by this rule.
