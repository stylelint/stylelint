# at-rule-no-deprecated

Disallow deprecated at-rules.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
    @viewport {}
/** â†‘
 * At-rules like this */
```

This rule flags at-rules that were removed or deprecated after being in the CSS specifications, including editor drafts, and were subsequently either:

- shipped in a stable version of a browser
- shipped by a developer channel/edition browser
- shipped but behind experimental flags
- polyfilled with some adoption before any browser actually shipped
- had an MDN page at one point in time

The [`fix` option](../../../docs/user-guide/options.md#fix) can automatically fix some of the problems reported by this rule.

The [`message` secondary option](../../../docs/user-guide/configure.md#message) accept arguments.
