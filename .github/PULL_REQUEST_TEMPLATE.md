Except for minor documentation fixes, each pull request must be associated with an open issue. If a corresponding issue does not exist, please stop. Instead, create an issue so we can discuss the change first.

If an issue exists, please continue by answering these two questions:  -->

> Which issue, if any, is this issue related to?

e.g. "Closes #000" or "None, as it's a documentation fix."

> Is there anything in the PR that needs further explanation?

e.g. "No, it's self-explanatory."
