# selector-no-qualifying-type

Disallow qualifying a selector by type.

    a.class {}
/** â†‘

```

The following patterns are considered warnings:

  margin: 0
}
```

```css

}
```

  margin: 0
}
```

```css
.class {
  margin: 0
}
```

```css
#id {
  margin: 0
}
```

```css
input {
  margin: 0
}
```
